This was an assignment for the capstone course of Macquarie University "Video Games Project" in which the team recieved a high distinction and was asked to give a presentation of the work to industry professionals at a night meeting among each department's top students in the university.

This repository is a reupload of the project, the complete project can be found with comments here: https://github.com/gotariz/COMP352_Project

I was in charge of UI: menus, options, sounds and some level design; while Tom was in charge of the game engine and level implementation.
